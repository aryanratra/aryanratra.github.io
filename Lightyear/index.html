        <h2>Buzz Lightyear</h2>
        <p>Buzz is a toy from a science fiction franchise of the same name. In his fictional backstory, Buzz is a
            universal space ranger from the Intergalactic Alliance and the captain of the Alliance's team. Buzz is
            trained in several forms of martial arts and is a highly skilled warrior in hand to hand combat. Being in
            peak physical condition, Buzz makes a perfect space ranger and is an example to many.

        <h3>Personality</h3>
        <p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <em>“Woody, we need to figure out what's best for everyone!”</em>
            <br>
            ―Buzz[src]
            <br>
            <br>
            Buzz, like many characters in Toy Story, is a complicated one, who feels genuine emotions such as pride,
            anger, depression, and sadness, much like a regular human. These are traits that he shares with his best
            friend, Woody, however, one could say that Buzz is better at keeping his emotions in check than the cowboy.
            Buzz is known for his bravery and courage with a by the book mindset, believing the way people should live
            their life by following the rules. Though there are rare moments when he will bend the rules or tell a cover
            story if needed to when he knows it is the right thing to do. Though possessing great leadership qualities,
            one of Buzz's biggest character flaws at times is that he can be rather unemotional.
            <br>
            Like Woody, Buzz also goes through an evolution throughout the series. In Toy Story, he was incredibly
            deluded and actually believed that he himself was the real Buzz Lightyear and would not listen when told
            that he's really a toy modeled off of the character. Because of this, Buzz believed he could do everything
            that a real space ranger was able to do such as fly and that his "laser" was a deadly weapon when it was
            actually just a light bulb. Since seeing the truth of his delusion, Buzz has shown a degree of embarrassment
            of it. In Toy Story 2, while being attacked by another Buzz Lightyear action figure who also thought he was
            the real Buzz Lightyear, Buzz remarked in a self-conscious and annoyed tone: "tell me I wasn't this
            deluded."

        <h3>Physical appearance</h3>
        <p>
            <br>
            <br>
            Buzz Lightyear is a brawny electronic spaceman action figure. He has fair skin, blue eyes, an outline of a
            swirl on his chin (which gives Buzz a cleft chin), a purple head cap and collar, a clear plastic space
            helmet with purple buttons on both sides that open or close it. His green torso consists of a light blue
            sticker that has the words "SPACE RANGER" and the Star Command symbol, purple straps connected to it, three
            oval talk buttons - one blue, one green, and one red, a yellow nametag that says "LIGHTYEAR" above a red
            button that pops out purple plastic glider wings with red and white candy cane lining on the top of each,
            and green ends with red and green flashing lights. On his back, he has a white jetpack with a purple valve
            and green triangular accents and two black and yellow stickers - one says, "DANGER", and the other says "JET
            EXHAUST". His white arms have gray circular elbows and matching spheres on the end of his upper arms with
            black rings on it. His gloves have purple lines on his knuckles and fingertips and green squares on the back
            of each. His right arm has a red button on his upper arm with a yellow and black striped sticker that reads
            "LASER" and a red light on his right wrist. His left arm has a Space Ranger symbol sticker on his upper arm
            and a communicator sticker in his wrist communicator (the latter of which is later peeled off) and "MADE IN
            TAIWAN" engraved inside on his lid of the wrist communicator. A black bending with a thin green waist. His
            white spaceman pants have matching collars at the bottom and gray spheres behind his knees and hold his
            white shoes with green toe accents, purple soles, and black handwriting reading "ANDY" on his right shoe
            sole.
